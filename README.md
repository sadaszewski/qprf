QPrf - MCMC Sampler for population receptive fields

This repository is currently a placeholder for my population receptive field (pRF) and Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic joint posterior MCMC sampler (C++) and associated utilities (Python). Once we manage with my co-authors to publish the accompanying research paper ("Metropolis-Hastings Sampling Scheme for Joint Estimation of Population Receptive Field and Hemodynamic Parameters") the GPLv3-licensed code will be made public here. We'd like to ask that the paper is cited if the code is used in your own research proceedings but it's not part of legal requirements of GPLv3. Thank you in advance!
