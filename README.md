QPrf - MCMC Sampler for population receptive fields

This repository is currently a placeholder for my population receptive field (pRF) and Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic joint posterior MCMC sampler (C++) and associated utilities (Python). Once we manage with my co-authors to publish the accompanying research paper ("Metropolis-Hastings Sampling Scheme for Joint Estimation of Population Receptive Field and Hemodynamic Parameters") the GPLv3-licensed code will be made public here.
